in this folder we store to different kind of function:

- propagation model 
- cost function


the propagation model are responsible of proapating the linear model to get the batch rapresentation of our mpc problem

the cost function computes the matrices H and g (for qpoases) using the results from the propagation models


both the two set of function has a specific signature that has to be satisfied in order to make them works with if you want to build one by 
yourself

propagation model signature

[S_bar, T_bar,Q_bar,R_bar] = propagationModel_regulator/tracker_fixed/ltv_actual_name_of_the_method(obj,A,B,C,Q,R)

    mandatory                     mandatory       mpc kind       ltv or not     authors choice           mandatory

for ltv method A and B are cell array (look at propagationModel_regulator_ltv_std.m for an example)


 const function signature

[H,F_tra]=regulator/tracker_actual_name_of_the_method(S_bar,T_bar,Q_bar,R_bar)
mandatory     mpc kind             authors choice             mandatory



inside the mpcModel configuration file in order to select the desired function it is only necessary to specify the actual_name_of_the_method the rest of the signature is automatically composed by the mpcGen constructor
